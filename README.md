In this project, I explored and implemented a range of Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designs using Verilog. This involved creating multiple ALU architectures capable of performing fundamental arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR. By writing and testing Verilog code, I developed a deep understanding of hardware description languages and digital circuit design principles. The project also included debugging and optimizing the designs to enhance performance and efficiency, providing valuable hands-on experience in the practical aspects of digital logic design.
